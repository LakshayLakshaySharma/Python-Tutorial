# operators in Python

# 1. Arthematic operator (+, -,*,/)
a = 3
b = 23

print('The addition of 3 + 23 is ', 3 + 23)
print('The addition of 3 - 23 is ', 3 - 23)
print('The addition of 3 * 23 is ', 3 * 23)
print('The addition of 3 / 23 is ', 3 / 23)

# 2. Assignment operator
a = 20
a += 10  # 20 + 10 = 
a -= 10 # 20 - 10 = 
a *= 10 # 20* 10 = 
a /= 10 # 20 / 10 =
print(a)

# # 3. Comparision operator
#  s = (10 > 5) #Greater then 
#  s = (10 < 5)   #smaller then
#  s = (10 <= 5) #smallerthen or equalsto 
#  s = (10 >= 5) #greaterthen or equalsto 
#  s = (10 == 5) # double equalsto 
# s = (10 != 5) #not equals to 
# print(s)

# 4. Logical operator 
bool1 = True
bool2 = False 

print('The value of bool1 and bool2 is ' , (bool1 and bool2))
print('the value of bool1 or bool2 is' , (bool1 or bool2))
print('the value of not bool1 is ', (not bool1))
