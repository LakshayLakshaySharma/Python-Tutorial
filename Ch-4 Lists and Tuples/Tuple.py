# Tuple
# t = (213,32,4,324,233,2)
# print(t)
# print(t[0])

# Empty tuple
# this is an empty tuple 
# t = ()
# print(t)

# tuple with only one element
# t = (2) this is a worg way to create a tuple with only one element, its confuse python with the integer datatype
# t = (2,) #this is a corret way to create a tuple with only one element
# print(t)

# tuples methods 
# 1. count 
# t = (1,2,3,4,4)
# print(t.count(4)) 

# 2. index method
t = (1,2,3,4,4)
print(t.index(2)) 
# the result will be 1 because the value 2 is in the index 1
